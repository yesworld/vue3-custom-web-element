# Vue 3 and Web Components

Web Components is an umbrella term for a set of web native APIs that allows developers to create reusable custom elements.

We consider Vue and Web Components to be primarily complementary technologies. Vue has excellent support for both consuming and creating custom elements. Whether you are integrating custom elements into an existing Vue application, or using Vue to build and distribute custom elements, you are in good company.
